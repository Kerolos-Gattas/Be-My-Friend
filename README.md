Known Issues/Bugs:  
Note: There is a slight issue where sometimes the characters will get stuck when moving on the ground. To get past that you can walk to the opposite side of the glitch and then walk straight towards the area with the problem, you should be able to get past the sticky point. #GameJamIssues #GameJamNoTimeLeft
